category: Ratings
---
Quality adherence refers to the product quality. We calculate it by looking at the returns from clients and QC done by Bizongo at the time of production. We want our clients to receive the quality we promise them. 
- Make sure that the quality of products you deliver is consistent with each unit and just as expected. 
- Poor quality of products or inconsistency in quality will result in a bad experience and will cause return of products.
