## What is Partner Rating?
We provide a rating to each of our partners to track their performance. This rating helps you as a partner in a lot of ways.
- Track your own performance
- Improve sales and payment terms with better ratings
- Earn rewards and exclusivity on terms and service     

Note: New partners have 5 rating to start off. You maintain the rating and earn rewards for your future orders.

## How do you calculate the rating?
The rating will depend on three main factors:
- #### Dispatch Adherence
    - DISPATCHED QUANTITY
    - DELAY IN DISPATCH
- #### Quality Adherence
    - CLIENT REJECTED SHIPMENT
- #### Platform Adherence
    - PO ADOPTION
    - SHIPMENT ADOPTION
