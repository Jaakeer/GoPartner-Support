This refers to the dispatch time and quantity. We promise our clients, a delivery on time and in full.      
- Make sure you dispatch the products on the specified date to avoid any delays
- Make sure the quantity is exactly what the client asked for
- Quantity less or more than the requirement, both cause issues therefore try to dispatch the correct quantity of goods
