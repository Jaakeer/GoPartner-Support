We review every Invoice for any order, and then it is cleared for payments. The payment depends on the time of delivery, payment terms and quality of the products after delivery.      
You can review invoice under settlement, to find out more details about payment terms and status of your payment.       
If your invoice is “On hold”, please resolve the issue by following the solution provided with the reason. “On hold” invoices are cleared as soon as the issue is resolved from your side.
