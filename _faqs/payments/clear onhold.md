When you open the on hold tab, you will find the reason and solution attached to the invoice in question. You need to resolve the issues and your invoice will be cleared for payment.      
For example, If you upload an invoice for 10000 units, whereas you created shipment for 9000 units. Finance team may flag your invoice and ask you to re upload the invoice with the correct quantity.      
When you re upload the invoice our finance team will review and confirm it. Then the invoice will move to “Under Review”.
