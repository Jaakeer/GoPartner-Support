title: If my purchase order is going in batches, how many invoices will be created?

For any order there can be multiple invoices. Every shipment will have one invoice.     
For example, if an order has 10 dispatches planned, then there will be 10 invoices. All the invoices will be under same PO number, but for each dispatch, there will be a different invoice.
