For any order the invoice is generated before the order is dispatched. If unfortunately, there is any issue with the order or the invoice. For example
- “There is a return”
- “There is a mismatch in invoice and order”
- “Order quantity is lesser than quoted on the invoice”, etc.       
The invoice becomes invalid for the amount.       
With so many orders, and documentation we do not annoy our partners for a new invoice. Therefore, we accept the generated invoice on some terms.        
That the partner will issue a credit note for the overdue of that particular order.
