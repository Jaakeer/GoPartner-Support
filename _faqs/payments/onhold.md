We review all the incoming invoices extensively. If there are any issues with the order, or the invoice itself, the Invoice is put on a temporary hold. This does not mean your order is cancelled. We resolve the issues with the invoice or the order first and then clear the invoice for payments. For more details on on hold payments:
- Go to the “On Hold” tab under “Settlements”
- You can see the details of the invoice, and reason for keeping the invoice on hold.
    - It can be due to Invoice issues (Upload the Invoice again)
    - It can be due to Credit note issues (Upload a credit note if you haven’t or upload the credit note again)
    - If there are any other issues, it will be provided as comments
- You can also see the solution suggested by our Finance team.
- Once you take necessary steps and the issues are taken care of, the invoice is cleared.
