To accept a new order please follow the instructions:
- Login to your account (Tool/app)
- Go to the “Purchase order” tab
- Click on “New”
- Here you will find all the orders assigned to you, click on “View PO details”
- You will be on a new page where you can review all the products, and their details. Scroll down.
- Review the order, and provide the timeline dates* here.
- Please go through them and click on “I have agreed to…” and then click on “Accept PO”. 
- It will ask for a confirmation, click on “Yes, Accept PO” to confirm.     
You have now accepted the order, now you can start working on the order.        

*Timeline dates for each dispatch plan will be different. Fill in the dates carefully, as missing to confirm timelines on the provided date counts as a breach.
Note: Once the PO is accepted timelines dates cannot be changed.
