Purchase orders are based on the quotes you provide. In case of any negotiation on prices, quantity and delivery timelines from clients, you will be alerted and asked for approval. A purchase order is created on your approval. In case you are still not sure about the order, you can “Reject” the Purchase order.     
Note: Once the PO is accepted timelines dates cannot be changed.
