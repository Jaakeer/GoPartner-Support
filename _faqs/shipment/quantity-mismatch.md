A ticket is created whenever a quantity mismatch is detected while creating a shipment. It is an automatic process, which assigns the ticket to fulfillment team. The internal team will review and confirm the quantity.       
If the internal team approve, the shipment will be created.     
If the internal team rejects, the shipment will not be created and partner will create a new shipment.
