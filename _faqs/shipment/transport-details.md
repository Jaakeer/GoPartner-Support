## What are the details you need for transport?
When partners take care of the delivery we need following details from them
- Truck:
    - E-way bill details
    - Truck type
    - Truck number
- Driver:
    - Name
    - Phone number
    
Note: Transport details are needed only when logistics are taken care of by the partner.

## What happens if I am not handling the transport?
If Bizongo is handling the transport you don’t need to provide any transport details, and you won’t see the option to provide any such details.
