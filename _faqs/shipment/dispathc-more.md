title: Can I dispatch more than the requirement?
category: Dispatch Plan
---
We donâ€™t allow any product quantity to be more or less than required quantity. There are very major reasons to do this.     
- Clients may not have the capacity to stock all the quantity.
- Client is not comfortable having less than the requirement.
- Transport may cause issue with excess quantity.
For any excess/less quantity, a ticket will be created and assigned to fulfillment team. Our team will review and approve before any order is dispatched.
