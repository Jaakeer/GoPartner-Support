title: I won a quote but I did not get an order; in what case I do not get an order?
category: Quote Process

For Purchase orders, we negotiate the terms, and review the prices and quantity as well. There can be disagreements on various points:      
- Client may refuse your quote        
- Partners may not agree with clientâ€™s prices or delivery terms
- Your quotes are not valid till client places the order
In such cases if the negotiation does not work out, no PO will be created.
