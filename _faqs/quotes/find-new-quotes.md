category: Quote Process

Whenever we request a new quote, we notify all concerned partners via text, emails, and through their tool/app. Whenever you open the tool/app you can find a deadline for the new quotation (If there is any).
You can find them under “Request for Quotes” tab on your dashboard. Where you can see, all the details and how much time is remaining.
