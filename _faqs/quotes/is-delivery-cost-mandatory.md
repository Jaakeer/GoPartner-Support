Ideally we want the cost breakup according to the price of the product and the delivery. This gives us a clear picture of the prices. We urge you to segregate the product and delivery prices for the sake of transparency.
In cases where you donâ€™t wish to commit delivery prices, you can include delivery prices to product price and give an overall price for the product and put zero as delivery price.
