We give our partners an opportunity to steal the next order with their best offer. We request for quotations from our partners for all orders, this request is opened for a time limit in which partners will enter their quote.
You quote a price and a delivery timeline for the order. This competes with other quotes provided by other partners. We shortlist these quotes and when an order comes in from the client; we send purchase orders to the corresponding partners.
