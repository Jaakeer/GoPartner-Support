For your ease there are two ways to confirm a timeline:
Go to "Ongoing orders". Find the PO for which you need to confirm the timeline for. Click on the "View PO details" to confirm the timeline.
Click on "Timelines" tab on top of the home screen. Confirm any scheduled timelines for that day.
Note: If you fail to confirm a timeline on the assigned date, it counts as a timeline breach.
